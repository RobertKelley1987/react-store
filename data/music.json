With ravishing grimness and impenetrable walls of noise, the duo of Chip King and Lee Buford create music that goes beyond what is normally considered harsh and violent, advocating a doctrine of misanthropy to those brave enough to take the plunge. Since their recording career began in earnest in 2004, The Body has expanded the definition of what it means to be a metal band, incorporating elements of noise, avant-garde composition, and experimental electronic music into their crushing doom and searing black metal foundation. Christs, Redeemers, the duo's latest transmission of loathing and revulsion, finds King and Buford pushing even further into the horrifying unknown.","Christs, Redeemers conjures this atmosphere of foreboding and isolation sonically, lyrically, and visually. The album opens with washes of sound and one forlorn voice penetrating the ether before launching into the brutal, ghostly dirge of “To Attempt Openness,” featuring frequent collaborators the Assembly of Light Choir. Unexpected bursts of noise, generated by guitars and electronics, puncture any sense of comfort or complacency and eerie samples float from the ether. King and Buford masterfully use the spectral space between the sounds to create almost unimaginable tension, employing silence as effectively as they do cacophony. This restraint, the knowledge of when to punish with volume and when to punish with the absence thereof, bestows the moments of fury with gravity.","King's screams are the centerpiece of the band's aesthetic: panic-stricken and distraught, constantly on the verge of breaking. His lyrics are no less unhinged. On the album's colossal closer “Bearer of Bad Tidings,” he shrieks “Life worthless and devoid of any meaning…all the world a grave.” Buford's drums act as both a stabilizer and instigator of the madness, at times pushing the proceedings further into oblivion and others providing a lifeline for the listener as the guitars and electronics deliberately push you toward the brink.","The album was recorded at Machines With Magnets in Pawtucket, RI, where The Body has recorded all previous album releases. During the recording process King and Buford play the double role of players and auteurs, bringing in a diverse group of collaborators, from the aformentioned Assembly of Light Choir to noise musician Work/Death and Ryan Seaton of Callers, to realize their hell scapes. They will be touring the US extensively in the fall."]},{"id":"the-body-i-shall-die-here-earth-triumphant-2xlp","category":"Music","featured":false,"productType":"2XLP","artist":"The Body","imgs":["the-body_i-shall-die-here-earth-triumphant-cover"],"desc":"I Shall Die Here / Earth Triumphant","price":29.99,"dateAdded":"2023-06-30T04:00:00.000Z","tracklist":["To Carry the Seeds of Death Within Me","Alone All the Way","The Night Knows No Dawn","Hail To Thee, Everlasting Pain","Our Souls Were Clean","Darkness Surrounds Us","Our New Genesis","No Sadness in the Many","A Testament to Willingness","A Cloud Broke Open","Wind on the Ocean, Wind on the Trees","Death at a Great Distance"],"albumDesc":["I Shall Die Here / Earth Triumphant is an expanded edition of the fourth full-length album by The Body, first released to widespread acclaim, and terror, in 2014. Sharing their moribund vision with Bobby Krlic, aka The Haxan Cloak, the tried and true sound of The Body is shred to pieces on I Shall Die Here, mutilated by process and re-animated in a spectral state by the collaboration. This double album set is expanded with the previously unreleased Earth Triumphant, a full-length companion album that would become I Shall Die Here, showcasing The Body's brutality in its most primal form. With both albums revisited by The Body and Seth Manchester at Machines With Magnets and remastered by Matt Colton at Metropolis Studios, this is the definitive edition of a shocking classic of unbridled bleakness and innovation. Formed by drummer Lee Buford and guitarist Chip King in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1999, The Body soon relocated to Providence, Rhode Island. The duo remained in Providence for a decade before moving west to their current home of Portland, Oregon. Their debut self-titled album (Moganano, 2003) and on the widely-acclaimed, classification curtailing of All the Waters of the Earth Turn to Blood (At A Loss, 2011) readied the band for even more experimentations. The employment of the Assembly of Light Choir's classical chorales on All the Waters, alongside more industrial music techniques such as vocal sampling and drum programming, prompted RVNG to inquire with King and Buford which darker corners of the electronic universe they were presumably interested in exploring. The undertaking of I Shall Die Here was aided by Seth Manchester and Keith Souza, The Body's long standing engineer and creative collaborator, and noted producer Bobby Krlic. Krlic's own work as The Haxan Cloak struck a similarly despairing chord to The Body with the celebrated Excavation (Tri Angle, 2013), itself a minimalist evocation of the afterlife. I Shall Die Here shares similar nether space with the morbidly deviating darkness of Excavation, but remains sculpturally frozen in a sort of earthen purgatory. The Body's musical approach, engraved by Buford's colossal beats and King's mad howl and bass-bladed guitar dirge, became something even more terrifying with Krlic's post-mortem ambiences serving as both baseline and outer limit. I Shall Die Here sonically serrates the remains of metal's already unidentifiable corpse and splays it amid tormented voices in shadow. This expanded edition gives us a window into the creation of a classic with the inclusion of its in utero twin, Earth Triumphant. Recorded as a nearly finished album by Buford and King before The Haxan Cloak's transformation, it stands as a raw statement of intent, the original DNA for what would soon mutate into something wholly new. Fans of I Shall Die Here will find familiar sonic fragments in a more primitive state - like seeing an out-of-context photograph of a family member taken well before you knew them - but the album stands on its own in its minimalist brutality, a natural bridge to what The Body was soon to become. The Body's I Shall Die Here / Earth Triumphant will be released in digital and vinyl formats on June 30, 2023. On behalf of The Body, The Haxan Cloak, and RVNG Intl., a portion of the proceeds from this release will benefit Intransitive, an organization that works to advance the cause of Trans liberation in Arkansas through art, education, advocacy, organizing and culture in order to create effective systemic change and on-the-ground impact."]},{"id":"the-body-no-one-deserves-happiness-2xlp","category":"Music","featured":true,"productType":"2XLP","artist":"The Body","imgs":["the-body_no-one-deserves-happiness-cover"],"desc":"No One Deserves Happiness","price":34.99,"dateAdded":"2016-03-18T04:00:00.000Z","tracklist":["Wanderings","Shelter Is Illusory","For You","Hallow / Hollow","Two Snakes","Adamah","Starving Deserter","The Fall and the Guilt","Prescience","The Myth Arc"],"albumDesc":["On No One Deserves Happiness, The Body\ns Chip King and Lee Buford set out to make “the grossest pop album of all time.” The album themes of despair and isolation are delivered by the unlikely pairing of the Body's signature heaviness and 80s dance tracks.

Equally at home on festival stages, art spaces, or in DIY basements, they transcend musical boundaries. Their ambitious creativity shapes their bleak worldview into propulsive, affecting, and even danceable music often drenched in distortion. On I Have Fought Against It, But I Can't Any Longer The Body challenged themselves again by turning their compositional approach on its head, choosing to build the record on their own samples rather than recording the basic tracks of drums and guitars and processing those. The results carry the listener towards the brink of emotional and musical extremes.

On I've Seen All I Need To See, they test the boundaries of the studio to explore the extremes and microtonality of distortion to find its maximal impact. Their most incisively bleak, a towering monolith of noise, album to date Buford's booming, resolute drums paired with King's obliterated guitar and howl. Course, bristling distortion contorts every instrument, with samples of spoken word, cymbals, toms and King's already noxious tone emerging from layers of feedback. The recording studio remains indelible to The Body's creative process. Together with engineer Seth Manchester of Machines With Magnets, they capture the complexities of distorted sound in stunning detail. The clarity and the cacophony exceed anything they've created before, morphing desolate, festering soundscapes into an exhilarating sonic universe. Buford often lays the framework for songs from the drums up, mirroring hip hop production. I've Seen All I Need To See trades out 808s and The Body's self-sampling for live instruments with a focus on expanding mutations of sound from more limited sources. The results are remarkably rich textural bombardments. Throughout, The Body deliver oppressive noise with potent lucidity, replicating the overwhelming sound of their live performances in revelatory detail. I've Seen All I Need To See demonstrates not only The Body's fearless spirit and vicious edge, but their intellectual musical heft through its explorations of distorted sound and the power of distorted sounds' interplay. Composer Roger Johnson said \"Noise is power, but is generally represented as negative, chaotic, dangerous, violent, when it comes... from those marginalized from power. Noise is also an expression of freedom, a 'liberation of sound.'\" The Body are sound liberators capable of mining and extracting remarkable details from the most manipulated and distorted sound sources. I've Seen All I Need To See is a groundbreaking work and an ecstatic listen, whether seen as a testament to catharsis in oblivion, an opus of inexorable dread or a wholly liberating adventure."]},{"id":"ragana-desolations-flower-lp","category":"Music","featured":false,"productType":"LP","artist":"Ragana","imgs":["ragana_desolations-flower-cover","ragana_desolations-flower-lp_1"],"desc":"Desolation's Flower","price":24.99,"dateAdded":"2023-08-10T04:00:00.000Z","tracklist":["Desolation's Flower","Woe","Ruins","DTA","Winter's Light Pt. 2","Pain","In the Light of the Burning World"],"albumDesc":["Ragana is a duo whose members alternate duties on drums, guitar, and vocals to produce some of the most unique and affecting dark music in metal today.

Since the release of their Profound Lore Records debut album “Full Of Hell & Merzbow” late 2014, their third full-length album, the band began to truly come into their own, combining elements of grindcore, death/black metal, punk and hardcore with a smattering of sonically laden power electronics and industrial pounding. It would also signal the band being at their most active and prolific ever since their inception in 2009.","The band would tour endlessly non-stop in different parts of the world in places as far off as Japan, Australia (twice), Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Philippines, South Korea etc.), along with several tour runs in Europe and many tour jaunts within the US, along with playing countless festivals and exclusive shows. The band would also add to their repertoire and discography as well during said timeframe releasing a direct collaboration album with The Body and several EPs, one of them being their most-recent split 7”EP with Nails (which debuts #2 on the Billboard Top 100 Singles Chart).","With “Trumpeting Ecstasy”, FULL OF HELL build upon their progression since the Merzbow collaboration and the releases succeeding it.

In the wake of releasing two full-length records in 2021 - We Are Always Alone and CHRISTFUCKER - they followed up 2022 with a year of relentless touring. In the middle of their frantic schedule, the band took time to draft the five new songs that would make up Devil Music with Viva Studios' Matt Michel (Majority Rule) in Virginia. They then took their creative vision to the next level with Ben Greenberg (Uniform), by tracking alternate versions of each song with orchestral arrangements in place of the three piece's standard instrumentation.","On Devil Music, Portrayal of Guilt's goal is to create a visceral listening experience. On either version of these songs, whether it be the a-side's more familiar heaviness or the orchestral b-side takes, the band is determined to drag the listener with them through what feels like a reckoning. Lyrics on songs like the opener “One Last Taste of Heaven\" feel burdened with a sense of finality - “I've carried this body for miles... I lay the angel on the wooden pyre / before taking one last taste of heaven” feels as heavy as the blackened guitar riff refraining throughout the song. Through other songs like the intense “Burning Hand” (complete with it's hypnotizing post-punk bridge) or the epic title-track closer, the imagery of King's lyrics is an unapologetically grotesque examination of loss, exhaustion and suffering - brought fully to life by illustrator Ben Robert's cover art for the release.","These songs are yet another example of Portrayal of Guilt pushing the limits of their sound into more extremes. Since their inception they have been challenging the boundaries of genre, taking elements from screamo, blackened metal, grind and industrial music to make something uniquely unsettling and expertly-crafted. Devil Music feels like the soundtrack to a future-less future, one where either path you tread is destined to lead towards ruin."]},{"id":"portrayal-of-guilt-we-are-always-alone-cd","category":"Music","featured":false,"productType":"CD","artist":"Portrayal of Guilt","imgs":["portrayal-of-guilt_we-are-always-alone-cover"],"desc":"We Are Always Alone","price":12.99,"dateAdded":"2021-03-01T05:00:00.000Z","tracklist":["The Second Coming","Anesthetized","A Tempting Pain","It's Already Over","Masochistic Oath","They Want Us All to Suffer","Garden of Despair","My Immolation","We Are Always Alone"],"albumDesc":["To say Portrayal of Guilt write grim songs is an understatement. Since forming in 2017, the Austin trio has been a flowing fountain of fatalism, spewing harsh and brutal sentiments across their releases. Now, on their second album, We Are Always Alone (Closed Casket, January 29th, 2021), the band turns the nihilism inwards and explores the notion of eternal isolation.","We Are Always Alone was written and recorded ahead of schedule. In March, Portrayal of Guilt was on tour in Atlanta when they realized the looming COVID-19 was about to render the remainder of their dates unsustainable. They packed up and drove home, where they immediately got to work crafting and recording nine new tracks with producer and frequent collaborator Phillip Odom (Code Orange, Turnover, La Dispute, Ceremony), with mastering by Grammy nominated engineer Will Yip. The album boasts vocal cameos from Matt Michel and Chris Taylor of Majority Rule and pageninetynine, two seminal bands to whom Portrayal of Guilt has often been deemed the heir apparent.","The album sees the band continuing to perfect their gritty style of charred punk that seamlessly fuses together a broad array of styles, from the piercing ferocity of screamo to the thick gnarls of black metal, underlined with chilling and ominous industrial samples. The LP is a climatic listening experience that never really lets the light peek through, instead building up to a cathartic final track that hammers home the bleak desolation that runs through it.","We Are Always Alone comes off the heels of the band's 2019 EP, Suffering Is a Gift, and their celebrated debut full-length in 2018, Let Pain Be Your Guide, which earned the band praise in outlets like NPR, Revolver, and Kerrang!. Even though it was birthed under the spectre of a global pandemic, it's hard to argue that We Are Always Alone is any more dire than the rest of the band's catalog. For a Portrayal of Guilt release, it seems par for the course."]},{"id":"soft-kill-savior-lp","category":"Music","featured":false,"productType":"LP","artist":"Soft Kill","imgs":["soft-kill_savior-cover"],"desc":"Savior","price":24.99,"dateAdded":"2018-05-15T04:00:00.000Z","tracklist":["Swaddle","Trying Not To Die","Bunny Room","Savior","Missing","Changing Days","Dancing On Glass","Cry Now, Cry Later","Do You Feel Nothing?","Hard Candy"],"albumDesc":["Released via PROFOUND LORE RECORDS in May 2018."]},{"id":"soft-kill-canary-yellow-lp","category":"Music","featured":false,"productType":"LP","artist":"Soft Kill","imgs":["soft-kill_canary-yellow-cover","soft-kill_canary-yellow-lp_1"],"desc":"Canary Yellow","price":24.99,"dateAdded":"2022-10-31T04:00:00.000Z","tracklist":["Joey","Cracked Candles","Magic Garden","Rocks & Blows","Dibs","The Line (feat.

Since those early days, lead singer Jeremy Bolm, guitarists Nick Steinhardt and Clayton Stevens, bassist Tyler Kirby, and drummer Elliot Babin have created a trajectory for themselves through hard work and dedication. And now with Stage Four, their fourth and biggest album to date, they are cementing their status as one of rock music's most talented, relatable, and visceral acts. Over the years the band rose to prominence with 2009's To the Beat of a Dead Horse and 2011's Parting the Sea Between Brightness and Me. Touche Amore crossed into new territory with the 2013 art-punk masterpiece Is Survived By. Having earned early cred, critical favor, and legions of fans by playing lengthy tours of all shapes and sizes, in every basement, youth center, and house show, the band enjoyed a bigger following which only grew along with their talents.","\"I don't open up to people too much in regular life, but when I'm writing songs, I want to be as open and as honest as possible,\" Bolm confesses. Touché albums have always served as an emotional outlet for Bolm. So when the time came to write Stage Four there was no question that it would be about passing of Bolm's mother in late 2014. Stage Four was recorded in early 2016 in Studio City, CA with producer Brad Wood. Cathartic in delivery, highly sentimental, and sonically triumphant, Stage Four is an emblem of a band both living its dream and marred by loss. And with Stage Four, Touche Amore has unmistakably made the biggest, boldest, and most artistic statement of their career."]},{"id":"touche-amore-lament-lp","category":"Music","featured":false,"productType":"LP","artist":"Touche Amore","imgs":["touche-amore_lament-cover"],"desc":"Lament","price":23.99,"dateAdded":"2020-09-09T04:00:00.000Z","tracklist":["Come Heroine","Lament","Feign","Reminders","Limelight\" (featuring Manchester Orchestra)","Exit Row","Savoring","A Broadcast","I'll Be Your Host","Deflector","A Forecast"],"albumDesc":["TOUCHÉ AMORÉ has been burrowing through angst, alienation, cancer, and heartbreak throughout four adored studio albums. After over a decade of working through darkness, the band's gorgeously gruff fifth album, Lament, finds the light at the end of the tunnel. Through 11 songs, Touche Amore looks back at its past and uses hard-won optimism to point its fans toward light, and love. For the follow up to the their critically acclaimed 2016 release, Stage Four, Touche Amore have opted to get out of their comfort zone and work with a new producer, the famously demanding Ross Robinson (Slipknot, Korn, At the Drive-In). Both Robinson and Touché Amoré are known for their trademark intensity. \"I believe there was an unspoken learning curve between Ross's methods and the understanding that I've poured myself into the words and mean every one of them,\" vocalist Jeremy Bolm says. Robinson agreed to a rare one-song \"test recording\" last summer, which resulted in the song \"Deflector,\" released last fall. In the end, \"Deflector\" proved the producer/band combo was undoubtedly the right fit. Robinson made Bolm read out all of his confessional lyrics to his bandmates to make sure they understood their emotional content. Making Bolm read those lyrics turned out to be what helped make their emotions palpable in the final recording. With its ruminations on the draining human connection (\"I'll test the water/I won't dive right in/That's too personal/I'm too delicate\"), Lament's first helping is a sharp intro to the album's themes. Lament is their masterstroke. Its longer, structured songs soar with a ferocious but delicate musicality and powerful, gut-wrenching storytelling that smashes previous heights. Yet as much as the band has grown and matured via everything they've endured, it's perhaps equally impressive how they've managed to stay true to their core..."]},{"id":"primitive-man-insurmountable-12in","category":"Music","featured":false,"productType":"12\"","artist":"Primitive Man","imgs":["primitive-man_insurmountable-cover","primitive-man_insurmountable-12in_1"],"desc":"Insurmountable","price":24.99,"dateAdded":"2022-05-18T04:00:00.000Z","tracklist":["This Life","Boiled","Cage Intimacy","Quiet (Smashing Pumpkins Cover)"],"albumDesc":["Listening to Primitive Man is a devastating experience of Doom as performed by just three members. Their discography of agonizing personal and universal hell is spread across three albums, two EPs and a raft of splits released over more than 10 years. 2020 saw the release of the groups most recent full length album 'Immersion' (Relapse Records), a terrifying and confrontational record that expressed resentment and the unbearable during uncertain times. The tension through out the record is palpable. McCarthy's foul roar feels wrenched from a cavern so deep that it defied language itself. The riffs are vast slabs - edifices dragged and erected to stand tall against the outrages of 'humanity rotten on the vine' ('Consumption'). With 2013's Scorn and 2017's Caustic, Primitive Man raged against religious dogma, elitism, capitalism and the creature within, desperate to burst out. They keep the animal inside at bay with a rancorous and cerebral blend of the heaviest sounds. Splits with Hell and Unearthly Trance, and a host of others, have seen the band branch out into experimental noise. Other projects from members of the band - Black Curse, Vermin Womb and Many Blessings - show how they are bursting at the seams to express their outrage at the state of things, in different mutations.","2022 brings the release of the groups latest album, Insurmountable.

The album captures a moment where a masterful songwriter strips away all flourishes and embellishments in order to make every note and word hit with maximum impact, leaving little to hide behind. “I really wanted to capture imperfection and the vulnerability of my humanity,” Rundle says of the album's sonic approach. “Here are some very personal songs; here are my memories; here is me teetering on the very edge of sanity dipping my toe into the outer reaches of space and I'm taking you with me and it's very fucked up and imperfect.”","Emma Ruth Rundle has always been a multifaceted musician, equally capable of dreamy abstraction (as heard on her album Electric Guitar: One), maximalist textural explorations (see her work in Marriages, Red Sparowes, Nocturnes or collaborations with Chelsea Wolfe and Thou), and the classic singer-songwriter tradition (exemplified by Some Heavy Ocean).

The 40 plus minute album was sewn together from recordings channeled during her month-long solo journey in the early days of 2020 and completed before 2021's critically lauded album Engine of Hell was even written.","Unlike Electric Guitar One, EG2: Dowsing Voice features vocal improvisation, unconventional singing and extended vocal techniques free from lyrics - like the throat singing on “In the Cave…” which is meant to be the voices of crones gathering in a rhythmic and physical ritual. Rundle was led to these voices by unseen forces along with the immense impact of the Welsh water: ocean, rivers springs and wells that gave the album its extended title Dowsing Voice. While there is some focus on vocal and story here, her textural and even bombastic guitar improvisations are featured throughout the album. The album is accompanied by a massive body of visual artwork Rundle created in her studio upon returning to the states in an attempt to further flesh out the world and beings she encountered in the landscapes and music during her trip to Wales.

A stunning pairing that shows Oathbreaker racing through razor sharp metallic riffing before erupting into a vicious emotional explosion. This quarrel continues throughout the \"Eros|Anteros\", finally coming to a head in the haunting closer \"Clair Obscur\". An eleven minute epic that carefully balances shoe-gaze leanings with their wounded post-metal heart."]},{"id":"oathbreaker-rheia-2xlp","category":"Music","featured":false,"productType":"2XLP","artist":"Oathbreaker","imgs":["oathbreaker_rheia-2xlp_1","oathbreaker_rheia-2xlp_2","oathbreaker_rheia-2xlp_3","oathbreaker_rheia-2xlp_4","oathbreaker_rheia-2xlp_5"],"desc":"Rheia","price":34.99,"dateAdded":"2016-09-30T04:00:00.000Z","tracklist":["10:56","Second Son of R.","Being Able to Feel Nothing","Stay Here / Accroche-Moi","Needles in Your Skin","Immortals","I'm Sorry, This Is","Where I Live","Where I Leave","Begeerte"],"albumDesc":["Released via DEATHWISH INC. in September 2016.","“Rheia” is the groundbreaking album from Belgium's Oathbreaker.Engineered, mixed, and mastered by Jack Shirley (Deafheaven,Loma Prieta), “Rheia” is a true game changer for the genre.Blurring lines and dissolving the boundaries of heavy musicas we know it today.","Opener “10:56” begins with a haunting guitar riff and Caro Tanghe's beautifully sung vocal before abruptly soaring to new heights with “Second Son of R”. Its blasts of melody mutate into a blackened buzz while waves of tempo changes pound down with intense emotional weight. “Being Able To Feel Nothing” then rolls in like a storm. Chaotically breaking apart to reveal the eye before churning once again. “Stay Here / Accroche-Moi” is an otherworldly reverb drenched acoustic number that leads to “Needles In Your Skin”. A deeply personal song that showcases the artistic strength vulnerability brings. It's hard to believe that this is just the half way point of this post everything masterwork. “Immortals” then unfurls as a goose bump inducing monster. This leads to the ambitious “I'm Sorry, This Is”, “Where I Live”, and “Where I Leave”; A musical triptych that needs to be heard to be believed. All of it comes to an end with mesmerizing closer “Begeerte”. Ethereally materializing before vanishing into the beautiful unknown."]},{"id":"undeath-lesions-of-a-different-kind-lp","category":"Music","featured":true,"productType":"LP","artist":"Undeath","imgs":["undeath_lesions-of-a-different-kind-lp_1","undeath_lesions-of-a-different-kind-lp_2","undeath_lesions-of-a-different-kind-lp_3"],"desc":"Lesions of a Different Kind","price":27.99,"dateAdded":"2020-05-22T04:00:00.000Z","tracklist":["Suitably Hacked To Gore","Shackles Of Sanity","Lesions Of A Different Kind","Entranced By The Pendulum","Acidic Twilight Visions","Lord Of The Grave","Kicked In The Protruding Guts","Phantasmal Festering","Chained To A Reeking Rotted Body","Archfiend Coercion Methods"],"albumDesc":["Skull crushing death metal reigns supreme; if the blood-spattered glory of Carcass is your (body) bag, if the headbang-inducing brutality of Cannibal Corpse is too much for you to resist, then UNDEATH have served up a feast for you.
