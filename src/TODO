- Error message when you don't select a size sucks. Does not go away when you leave page.
Should I just use default size small like Evil Greed?
- Review for use of main tags
- style sort feature
- work on featured items data
- when I click middle section of store path, I need the filters to reset... how do I do that in
a way that isn't sloppy?
