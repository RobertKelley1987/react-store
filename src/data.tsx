        ' Picher, Oklahoma. These effigies would come to be the namesake for the Oklahoma' +

        ' to terrorize listeners worldwide in only a matter of months.'

        price: 21.99,
        albumDesc: 'There’s a sick irony to how a country that extols rhetoric of individual' + 
        ' freedom, in the same gasp, has no problem commodifying human life as if it were meat' + 
        ' to feed the insatiable hunger of capitalism. If this is American nihilism taken to its' + 
        ' absolute zenith, then God’s Country, the first full length record from Oklahoma City noise' +
        ' rock quartet Chat Pile is the aural embodiment of such a concept.\n\n' +

        'Having lived alongside the heaps of toxic refuse that the band derives its name from, the' + 
        ' fatalism of daily life in the American Midwest permeates throughout the works of Chat Pile,' + 
        ' and especially so on its debut LP. Exasperated by the pandemic, the hopelessness of climate' + 
        ' change, the cattle shoot of global capitalism, and fueled by “...lots and lots and lots and' + 
        ' lots and lots and lots of THC,” God’s Country is as much of an acknowledgement of the Earth’s' +
        ' most assured demise as it is a snarling violent act of defiance against it. Within its over 40' +
        ' minute runtime, God’s Country displays both Chat Pile’s most aggressively unhinged and' +
        ' contemplatively nuanced moments to date, drawing from its preceding two EPs and its score for' + 
        ' the 2021 film, Tenkiller. In the band’s own words, the album is, at its heart, “Oklahoma’s' + 
        ' specific brand of misery.” A misery intent on taking all down with it and its cacophonous' + 
        ' chaos on its own terms as opposed to idly accepting its otherwise assured fall. This is what' + 
        ' the end of the world sounds like. God’s Country is out via The Flenser.\n\n' +

        'In just a couple of years, Oklahoma City’s Chat Pile has made nothing short of a profound' + 
        'impression on the underground music discourse. Formed in the spring of 2019 by Raygun Busch' + 
        '(vocals), Luther Manhole (Guitar), Stin (Bass), and Captain Ron (Drums), the noise-rock quartet' + 
        'would release two EPs that same year, titled This Dungeon Earth and Remove Your Skin Please' + 
        'respectively. Spurred on by both a hearty run of live performances and a swiftly growing online' + 
        'fanbase, Chat Pile became a staple name among its genre contemporaries thanks to its hellish' + 
        'synthesis of noise rock, sludge, industrial, and mid 90’s nu-metal. In 2020, the band would sign' + 
        'with San Francisco underground music label, The Flenser, to put out its upcoming full length debut.' + 
        'That following year, Chat Pile kept its roll going, with accolades including composing the score' + 
        'for the indie film, Tenkiller, as well as releasing a 7” split with portrayal of guilt in the summer.' + 
        'Despite its creation only a couple of years ago, Chat Pile has already played alongside a number of' + 
        'acclaimed underground acts, including Street Sects, portrayal of guilt, Psychic Graveyard and Distorted' + 
        'Pony .'

        albumDesc: 'For something to be “ecstatic,” the feelings and emotions it evokes must transcend' +
        ' what we tend to experience most regularly in our lives. Ecstatic joy isn’t just happiness;' +
        ' it’s a feeling of jubilation which impacts us emotionally and in a metaphysical, arguably' +
        ' spiritual sense too. Although it has long been associated with connotations of the dark and' +
        ' macabre, extreme music has the ability to be a powerful mode of expression for these feelings' +
        ' of absolute bliss, overwhelming love, and awe-inspiring sublimity. Extreme emotions no less and' + 
        ' those which black metal quartet Agriculture evokes with its ecstatic subversion of the subgenre’s' +
        ' tropes.\n\n' +

        ' What was initially a meeting and subsequent series of jam sessions between Kern Haug and Daniel Meyer,' + 
        ' two musicians in the Los Angeles underground noise scene, would eventually manifest as a shared vision' + 
        ' to portray the sublimity of the human experience through the vehicle of heavy music. Following the' +
        ' additions of veteran guitarist Richard Chowenhill and bassist/vocalist Leah Levinson to the band’s lineup,' + 
        ' this idea would crystalize into the “ecstatic black metal” backbone of Agriculture’s music, first heard on' 
        + 'the band’s 2022 debut EP, The Circle Chant.\n\n' +

        'With Agriculture’s self-titled record and first full-length LP, it’s abundantly clear that the band’s' + 
        ' use of heavy music to showcase the most resplendent emotions and moments of the human experience has' +
        ' a far deeper meaning. Woven between the flurries of soaring tremolo picking, crescendoing guitar' +
        ' harmonies, celebratory screamed vocals, thoughtful improvisation, and meditative atmospheric passages' + 
        ' is the record’s mission statement to experience the wonders and joys of both the esoteric and physical' + 
        ' world. From examinations of self-acceptance, identity, and finding strength in others on “Look Pt.2” to' +
        ' depictions of deep communion with nature, the self, and the people we surround ourselves with in “The' + 
        ' Glory of the Ocean” and “The Well”, the concepts and thematic questions previously planted by the band' + 
        ' have blossomed into powerful, fully-realized artistic and philosophical statements. To put it in the band’s' + 
        ' words, “...Where The Circle Chant is like a finger pointing at the moon, the self-titled LP is like a whole' + 
        ' body screaming at it with reverence.” Through the extreme splendor of ecstatic black metal and the' +
        ' improvisational, experimental, and cathartic elements it embodies, Agriculture illustrates these otherwise' + 
        ' incomprehensible questions with a poignant beauty that makes its music as much of an artistic statement as it' + 
        ' is a transcendental experience.'

        ' Serving as an artistic lucid dream of warmth despite the stinging pain of life\'s cruel idealism\n\n.' +

        'With opener "Dream House" George Clarke\'s tortured vocals familiarly intertwine with Kerry McCoy\'s hypnotic' + 
        ' guitar work before crashing into a wash of post-everything melody. This leads to the moving instrumental' +
        ' "Irresistible" a track that carries a twisted indie-like sensibility buried beneath glittery layers of guitar' + 
        ' and piano. However it is in the title track and beyond where the maturation and growth of Deafheaven brightly' + 
        ' shines. In "Sunbather" they explore sonic peaks and valleys created by superb percussionist Daniel Tracy (new' + 
        ' to the band for this recording). His inclusion brings new dynamics to light as an urgent pulse to the swirling' +
        ' musical chaos. Pushing bleak epic "Vertigo" and the dark emotional closer "The Pecan Tree" to new, awe-inducing' +
        ' heights.\n\n' +
        
        'Without question "Sunbather" is Deafheaven at the peak of their creative strength and vision of their young' + 
        ' existence. A masterfully crafted work of art that will be renowned for years to come.'
